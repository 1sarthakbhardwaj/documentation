This guide covers navigating the Labellerr dashboard:

* **Dashboard Overview** - Your home screen and main navigation hub
* **Status Bar Elements** - Real-time annotation progress tracking
* **Self-Generated Graphs** - Activity tracking and progress visualization
* **Quick Actions** - Accessing projects and tasks efficiently
</Card>

The dashboard is your home screen. All tasks can be accessed through the dashboard. Every time the user logs in, the dashboard displays all the actions and progress (which changes in real-time). The Dashboard Shows the Status Bar and some self-generated statistics used for tracking progress.

## Status bar Elements

The Status bar displays Annotation progress in real-time and helps keep track of the user activity. The most important elements are the Total files, Accepted, remaining, and Percentage completion. This automatically updates itself when new files are added to the project.
